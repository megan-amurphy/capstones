- Capstone projects that showcase my growth as a software developer. These were group projects with my classmates while I studied at Tech Elevator. 


## Update on TEnmo App
- 07/30/2024: After being graded and given critique on Capstone TEnmo project, I updated the project code to remove bugs and errors. Details as followed:
    - When the user views their current balance, all the data was being called by the AccountId, not UserId. Adjusted the DAO, and Controller on server-side to correct endpoints. Then updated client side.
